# Unity Project Template

A template Unity project is available on request from the repository author.  Due to its size (~1 GB zipped), it cannot be uploaded here.  Please note that you will need to supply your own medical imaging and surface data as no patient information is included in the template project. You will also need to provide your own license keys for Vuforia an the Merge Cube SDK (both available for free from their respective sources). 

Once you have supplied surface data (by copying it into the project Assets/OBJ_Files/ folder), you will need to add it to the scene in the appropriate place.  For non-hollowed segmentations, they should be dragged into the Scene Hierarchy under SolidSegContainer;  likewise hollowed segmentations should be dragged under HollowSegContainer.  Once this is done, you should be able to preview the augmented reality app by pressing the play button and holding your Merge Cube so that it is visible to the computer's webcam.
